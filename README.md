Web App for Financial Dashboards
This project is a cryptocurrency data dashboard and chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 model. It uses Streamlit, a fast and easy way to build data apps in Python, to create an interactive web application. The project fetches cryptocurrency data from Kucoin, generates summaries using OpenAI's language model, and provides a chatbot interface for user interactions.

Python: The main programming language used for this project.
Streamlit: An open-source Python library used to create the web application.
OpenAI's GPT-3: A powerful language model used to generate text summaries and power the chatbot.
Kucoin API: Used to fetch cryptocurrency data.
Plotly: A Python graphing library used to create interactive plots.
Pandas: A Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.
Features
Cryptocurrency Data Dashboard: Fetches and displays cryptocurrency data from Kucoin. Includes interactive candlestick charts for each ticker pair.
AI-Generated Summaries: Uses OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate summaries for each ticker pair.
Chatbot Interface: Allows users to interact with the application via a chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 model.
How to Use
Set up your environment: Make sure you have Python installed and set up on your machine. You'll also need to install the required Python libraries, which you can do by running pip install -r requirements.txt in your terminal.

Provide your OpenAI API key: You'll need to provide your OpenAI API key to use the GPT-3 model. You can do this by adding it to the secrets.toml file.
